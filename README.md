# somatic-mutation-pipeline
This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline designed for the analysis of somatic mutations in tumor-normal pair sequencing data using GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit). The pipeline utilizes Mutect2 for somatic variant calling and GATK tools for subsequent filtering and annotation of detected mutations.
